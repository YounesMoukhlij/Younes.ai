Dear Reviewers,  

I sincerely apologize for not being able to upload the demo video of my website as planned. Unfortunately, I experienced persistent internet connectivity issues due to a problematic router, which caused severe lag and frequent disconnections throughout the day. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to successfully upload the recorded video.  

I understand the importance of a live demonstration and will prioritize uploading the video as soon as my internet connection stabilizes. Alternatively, I’d be happy to schedule a live walkthrough if needed.  

Thank you for your understanding and patience. Please let me know if you’d like any additional details in the meantime.  

Best regards and thanks a lot for your understanding.
