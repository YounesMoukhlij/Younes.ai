### Demo Video

Dear Reviewers,

I sincerely apologize for not being able to submit the demo video of my website as expected. Unfortunately, I encountered severe internet connectivity issues throughout the day due to a faulty router, which caused constant lag and disruptions. Despite working diligently on the challenge and attempting multiple times to upload the video, the connection was too unstable to complete the upload successfully.


I truly regret that technical difficulties prevented me from sharing the video demonstration, as I put significant effort into this project and wanted to showcase it properly. As soon as my internet connection stabilizes, I will upload the video and notify you immediately. Alternatively, I’d be happy to schedule a live demo at your convenience.

Thank you for your understanding and for considering my work despite these unexpected challenges. Please let me know if there’s any additional information I can provide.
