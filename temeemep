Create this section : AI Integration Hub
-----------Description-------------
1 - Develop a section within your application that serves as the central point for **Google Gemini Live API integration**. This hub should feature an **AI voice chat** capability that enables natural conversations with the AI assistant.



2 - Based on this implementation, you need to extend its functionality by **adding OpenAI integration**, so we can easily switch between OpenAI and Genmini by setting an environment variable.

3 - This Section should look like the other sections.
